Title: Sending Emails Using Instantly API (V2)

Overview:
The Instantly API (V2) enables users to send emails through campaign workflows and automated replies. It supports advanced campaign features, but does not allow for free-form transactional emails. Below is a guide to using the API for sending emails, including detailed information about the key endpoints.

Steps to Send Emails:

1. Set Up Your Instantly Workspace:
   - Create an account at https://instantly.ai.
   - Connect your email account(s) to your Instantly workspace.

2. Generate an API Key:
   - Navigate to Workspace Settings > API Keys.
   - Create a new API key with scopes such as:
     - `campaigns:read`
     - `campaigns:create`
     - `emails:create`
     - `leads:create`

3. Create a Campaign:
   - Endpoint: POST `/v2/campaigns`
   - Description: Creates a new campaign.
   - Required Payload:
     ```json
     {
       "name": "My New Campaign",
       "email_account_id": "your_connected_email_id",
       "sequence": [
         {
           "subject": "Hello!",
           "body": "This is my first email in the sequence.",
           "day": 1
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

4. Add Leads to a Campaign:
   - Endpoint: POST `/v2/campaigns/{campaign_id}/leads`
   - Description: Adds contacts to the campaign.
   - Required Payload:
     ```json
     {
       "leads": [
         {
           "email": "john@example.com",
           "first_name": "John",
           "last_name": "Doe"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

5. Monitor Campaign and Email Status:
   - Endpoint: GET `/v2/campaigns/{campaign_id}`
   - Use this to check campaign status, leads, and performance.
   - Endpoint: GET `/v2/leads/{lead_id}/emails` to view email history for a lead.

6. Send a Reply to a Previous Email:
   - Endpoint: POST `/v2/emails/reply`
   - Description: Sends a reply to a previously sent message in a thread.
   - Required Payload:
     ```json
     {
       "lead_id": "abc123",
       "body": "Thanks for your reply!",
       "subject": "Re: Previous Subject"
     }
     ```

Limitations:
- Instantly is not suitable for one-off transactional email sending.
- All emails must be part of a campaign or reply to an existing conversation.
